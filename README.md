# scheduler
Daily Schedule Manager created using OCR

===========About this App===========


So , Basically this project is about a Routine Manager for Students,
Teacher, Doctor , Engineer , Pilot , Clerk etc. no matter what position you
are in, this app helps to remind you about your each and every Schedule of
the day. From now on, you don’t have to keep note or Pictures of your
routine and go in your files or note to time to keep track of your time. This
app does it all.
Let’s take an Example of  Colleges/Universities Routine. So , we students
face a lot of trouble to keep note of routine of our respective groups and
because of the lot of routines kept together in a Notice board ( or in a pdf file/image) and sometimes
these routine gets mixed up.
So, to overcome this, I decided to develop an Android App which Stores
data of the Respective group based on the keyword entered. For Example,
if you are from group C6 (section eg. Section A) , Just enter the KeyWord “C6” and Scan the Piece
of Paper where your routine are posted... And BAM, Your device will store
the data of your respective group. Aditionally, There will be  features like
Remainder to help keep you better track of your time.

=======================================================

This is an ongoing project and is not completed yet.
I want to extract data only from the particular group based on the Unique Keyword from the Group(Eg: C6 or C3 ).
I have uploaded  the Image here in the Github Itself as Routine.jpg..Feel free to contribute in this Project..
